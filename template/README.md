# foundry-react

Element studios template for layout and structure.
This is how we like to do it but it can be used by any one.

js entry point ** /app/index.tsx **
scss entry point ** /app/styles/scss/ui.css **
css entry point ** /app/styles/css/ui.css **
html entry point (after installing react create app) ** /public/index.html **

will need to set up aliases in tsconfig and webpack (both dev and live) and set up package.json.
for compile speeds please change webpack dev config to use async: true and silent: false

currently using this with react create app typescript
